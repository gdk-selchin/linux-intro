🔹 What is a Storage System?
----------------------------

Think of your computer like a house.

* The **storage system** is like the **cupboards, shelves, and boxes** where you keep your stuff (documents, videos, photos, etc.).
* Ubuntu uses a structure to organize all these things in a clear and logical way.

* * *

🔸 Basic Terms to Know
----------------------

### 1\. **Files**

* A file is like a piece of paper or a photo you put in a box.
* Examples: `photo.jpg`, `document.txt`, `video.mp4`

### 2\. **Folders (also called Directories)**

* Folders are like containers (boxes or drawers) that hold files.
* You can put other folders inside a folder (just like putting a small box inside a bigger one).

### 3\. **File System**

* This is the full **organization system** used to manage files and folders.
* Ubuntu uses something called a **"hierarchical file system"** — like a big tree:
    * The top of the tree is `/` (called “root”).
    * Inside `/` you have many important folders like `/home`, `/etc`, `/bin`, etc.

* * *

🔸 Important Folders in Ubuntu
------------------------------

Here are some folders you'll often hear about:

| Folder | What it stores | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Root folder (the start of everything) | Think of it as the main shelf |
| `/home` | Your personal files | Documents, Downloads, etc. |
| `/etc` | System settings/configuration | Like setting files for Wi-Fi |
| `/bin` | Basic programs/commands | Like `ls`, `cp`, etc. |
| `/var` | Log files and app data | Keeps records of system messages |
| `/dev` | Devices | Your USB, hard disk, etc. appear here |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files | Things the system doesn't need for long |

* * *

🔸 Example Folder Tree (Like a Map)
-----------------------------------

    /
    ├── home/
    │   └── yourname/
    │       ├── Documents/
    │       ├── Pictures/
    │       └── Downloads/
    ├── etc/
    ├── bin/
    └── tmp/


* * *

📝 Quick Recap
--------------

* Ubuntu stores files using folders.
* Everything starts from `/` (root).
* `/home/yourname` is your personal space.
* Other folders like `/etc` or `/bin` are for the system.

* * *

✅ Your Turn – Quick Questions
-----------------------------

Try to answer these:

1.  What is a **file**?
2.  What is the **/home** folder used for?
3.  What does the **/** (root) folder mean?
4.  What folder contains the settings/configuration files?
5.  What does **/tmp** store?

Let me know your answers, and I’ll help correct or explain if needed. Once you're confident, we can move to the next part: **file paths and basic commands to see files/folders**.

Explain me about different file system and mount

Awesome! You're doing great 👍
Now let’s learn two new things:

* * *

📁 Part 1: **Different File Systems**
=====================================

A **file system** is like the _format or rulebook_ that tells the computer **how to store and find files on a disk** (like a hard drive, SSD, or USB).

* * *

🧱 Think of File Systems Like Languages
---------------------------------------

Different file systems are like different languages. For example:

* English
* Hindi
* Tamil

They all let you speak, but in different ways.

In the same way, different file systems **store files in different formats**, but all do the same basic job: help your system read, write, and organize files.

* * *

💡 Common File Systems
----------------------

| File System | Used In | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ext4** | Ubuntu/Linux | Most common in Ubuntu. Stable and fast. |
| **FAT32** | USB drives, old devices | Works everywhere but has limits (e.g., max 4GB per file). |
| **exFAT** | USB drives, modern use | Like FAT32 but supports big files. |
| **NTFS** | Windows | Used by Windows. Ubuntu can read/write it too. |
| **Btrfs** | Linux (advanced use) | Has extra features like snapshots. |
| **XFS** | Linux servers | Good for large file storage. |

* * *

💬 Example:
-----------

* Your Ubuntu hard disk: likely **ext4**
* Your USB drive: probably **FAT32** or **exFAT**
* A Windows drive you plug in: **NTFS**

* * *

🧷 Part 2: **What is Mounting?**
================================

Now that you know file systems, let’s talk about **"mounting"**.

* * *

### 📦 What Does "Mount" Mean?

When you plug in a USB or hard disk, Ubuntu needs to **"mount"** it.

👉 Mounting means:

> "Hey Ubuntu, connect this storage device to the system so I can use it."

Without mounting, Ubuntu cannot read or use that disk.

* * *

🗂️ Example:
------------

Imagine plugging in a USB drive. Ubuntu might mount it to:

    /media/yourname/MyUSB/


That means:

* `/media/yourname/MyUSB/` is the **door** to your USB’s files.
* Inside that folder, you can now see your USB’s contents.

* * *

⚙️ Mount Points
---------------

A **mount point** is just the folder where the device appears when mounted.

Examples:

* Hard disk: `/mnt/data`
* USB: `/media/yourname/USBDrive`
* CD: `/media/cdrom`

* * *

⛔ Unmount (or "Eject")
----------------------

When you remove a USB safely, Ubuntu **unmounts** it.

This means:

> "Disconnect this device safely so nothing gets corrupted."

* * *

📝 Quick Recap
--------------

* A **file system** is the format a disk uses to store files (ext4, FAT32, etc.).
* **Mounting** makes a disk usable by connecting it to a folder (mount point).
* You **unmount** to safely remove it.

* * *

✅ Your Turn – Quick Questions
-----------------------------

Try answering:

1.  What is a file system? Name two types.
2.  What is mounting?
3.  What happens if a device is not mounted?
4.  What file system does Ubuntu commonly use?
5.  What does unmounting do?

Reply with your answers, and I’ll check them. Then we’ll move on to:
👉 **Using terminal commands to check disks and mounts (like `lsblk`, `df`, `mount`)**.

LVM

Great! Now you're asking about **LVM**, which is an important and powerful concept in Ubuntu and Linux storage. Let me explain it in a very simple way.

* * *

🔶 What is LVM?
===============

**LVM** stands for **Logical Volume Manager**.

### 💬 In simple words:

> LVM lets you manage storage **flexibly**.
> It allows you to create, resize, or combine storage **without worrying about physical disks**.

* * *

### 📦 Real-life Example:

Imagine your storage is like a set of water tanks.

* With normal storage, each tank is separate. If one is full, you can’t easily add more water.
* With LVM, you **combine many tanks into one big pool**, and take as much water (space) as you want from it, or even add more tanks later!

* * *

🧱 Why use LVM?
===============

| Feature | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 🔄 Resize volumes | Make space bigger or smaller when needed |
| ➕ Add disks | Add new storage devices without restarting |
| 🧩 Combine disks | Merge many small disks into one large space |
| 📂 Create snapshots | Save a temporary backup view of your files |
| 📦 Divide space logically | Create custom partitions like `/home`, `/var`, `/data` easily |

* * *

🧰 LVM Components (3 Layers)
============================

LVM has 3 parts. Think of them as building blocks:

### 1\. **Physical Volume (PV)**

> Real storage like hard disks, SSDs, or partitions

Example:

    /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1


### 2\. **Volume Group (VG)**

> Combines one or more PVs into one big pool of storage

Example:

    vg_main


### 3\. **Logical Volume (LV)**

> Like "virtual partitions" made from the Volume Group.

Example:

    /dev/vg_main/root
    /dev/vg_main/home


* * *

🗂️ Summary in Structure
------------------------

    [Disk or Partition] -> PV
    [PVs combined] -> VG
    [Space from VG] -> LV


And LVs are used like regular partitions (you mount them, format them, etc.)

* * *

🧑‍🏫 Example Scenario
======================

You have 2 disks:

* `/dev/sda1` = 100 GB
* `/dev/sdb1` = 200 GB

With LVM:

* Make both disks PVs.
* Combine them into a VG called `vg_data` (total 300 GB).
* From that, create:
    * LV called `lv_docs` (100 GB)
    * LV called `lv_media` (150 GB)
    * Leave 50 GB for future use

Now if later you get a third disk, you can add it to `vg_data` and create more LVs!

* * *

✅ Your Turn – Quick Questions
=============================

1.  What does LVM stand for?
2.  Why is LVM useful?
3.  What are the 3 main parts of LVM?
4.  Can you add more disks to an existing LVM setup?
5.  What is the difference between a VG and an LV?

Try answering and I’ll guide you further.
Next, we can see **how to check and use LVM from Ubuntu terminal** (using commands like `lvdisplay`, `vgdisplay`, `pvcreate`, etc.).

Just let me know what you want to do next 😊

Explain about port

Great! Let's learn about **ports** in a very simple way — like you’re just starting out. 😊

* * *

🧠 What is a **Port**?
----------------------

Imagine your computer is like a **big apartment building**.
Inside it, there are many **doors** (called ports), and each door leads to a **different room** (which can be a program, app, or service).

When someone (like a website, app, or device) wants to **talk to a program on your computer**, they need to knock on the **right door** — the correct port.

* * *

📬 Why are Ports Used?
----------------------

Because **many programs can use the network at the same time**, ports help computers **organize network traffic**.

### 📦 Example:

When you open a web page:

* Your browser uses **port 80** (for normal websites) or **443** (for secure/HTTPS sites).
* If you're using **SSH** (remote access), it usually uses **port 22**.

* * *

🏷️ Ports have numbers!
-----------------------

* Ports go from `0` to `65535`.
* But they’re grouped into categories:

| Port Range | Name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 – 1023 | Well-known ports (reserved) | 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH), 443 (HTTPS) |
| 1024 – 49151 | Registered ports | 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL) |
| 49152 – 65535 | Dynamic/private ports | Used by apps for temporary connections |

* * *

📡 Common Ports You Should Know
-------------------------------

| Port | Purpose | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20, 21 | FTP (File Transfer) | Moving files between systems |
| 22  | SSH | Secure remote login |
| 23  | Telnet | (Old) remote login |
| 25  | SMTP | Sending emails |
| 53  | DNS | Finding websites |
| 80  | HTTP | Websites (non-secure) |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure websites |
| 3306 | MySQL | Database |
| 8080 | HTTP (alt) | Often used by apps |

* * *

🛠️ Commands to Work with Ports in Ubuntu
-----------------------------------------

### 🔹 Check if a port is **open or in use**:

    sudo netstat -tulnp


Or:

    sudo ss -tuln


You’ll see lines like:

    LISTEN  0  128  0.0.0.0:22     0.0.0.0:*   users:(("sshd",pid=812))


That means **port 22 is being used by SSH**.

* * *

### 🔹 Check if a port is **open on a remote machine**:

    telnet example.com 80


Or:

    nc -zv example.com 80


* * *

🔐 Can Ports Be Dangerous?
--------------------------

Yes! If an unused port is left open, **hackers can try to attack** the program behind it.

👉 That’s why firewalls block unused ports.

* * *

✅ Simple Example
----------------

Let’s say:

* Your Ubuntu system has a web server like Apache installed.
* It listens on **port 80**.

That means when someone types your IP in their browser, the browser connects to your computer’s **port 80**, and sees the website you’re hosting.

* * *

🧪 Quick Questions for You
--------------------------

1.  What is a port in simple terms?
2.  What does **port 22** usually do?
3.  How can you check which ports are open on your Ubuntu machine?
4.  Why is **port 443** considered safer than port 80?

* * *

When you're ready, we can learn: 👉 How to open/close ports with **UFW (Ubuntu Firewall)**
👉 How to check what process is using a specific port
👉 Or move to **SSH, networking, or web server setup**

Let me know 😄

Explain about networking

Awesome! Let's now understand **networking in Ubuntu** — in very simple English. 😊

* * *

🧠 What is Networking?
----------------------

> Networking is how computers **talk to each other** and **share things** — like files, websites, or messages.

Imagine computers are **people in a city**, and networking is the **roads, addresses, and phones** they use to **communicate**.

* * *

🧱 Basic Terms (Like a Beginner!)
---------------------------------

| Term | Simple Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **IP Address** | Like a **house address** for a computer |
| **MAC Address** | Like a **fingerprint** for a device’s network card |
| **Router** | Like a **post office** — routes data to the right place |
| **Switch** | Like a **traffic hub** — connects many devices inside a building |
| **Modem** | Like a **gate** to the outside internet |
| **DNS** | Like a **phonebook** — it finds website names (like google.com) and turns them into IP addresses |

* * *

🧪 Example
----------

When you open `www.google.com` in your browser:

1.  Your system asks **DNS**: “Hey, what’s Google’s IP?”
2.  DNS says: “It's `142.250.190.68`”
3.  Your computer **sends a message** to that IP.
4.  Google’s servers **reply** and show the page.

* * *

🖧 Types of IP Addresses
------------------------

| Type | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPv4 | 192.168.1.10 | Common old style address |
| IPv6 | fe80::1f2b:... | Newer, longer format |
| Local IP | 192.168.x.x | Used in home/private networks |
| Public IP | 103.56.78.9 | Seen by the whole internet |
| Loopback | 127.0.0.1 | “This computer talking to itself” |

* * *

🔧 Ubuntu Networking Commands
-----------------------------

### 1\. 🧍 See your IP address:

    ip a


You’ll see something like:

    inet 192.168.1.100/24


That’s your **local IP**.

* * *

### 2\. 🌍 Test if you're connected to the internet:

    ping google.com


It keeps sending test messages to Google.

Stop it with `Ctrl + C`.

* * *

### 3\. 🌐 See where a website is hosted:

    nslookup openai.com


Shows its IP address.

* * *

### 4\. 📦 See who you're connected to:

    netstat -tun


* * *

### 5\. 🚪 See which ports are open:

    sudo ss -tuln


* * *

### 6\. 🔄 Restart network in Ubuntu:

    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager


* * *

🔐 Simple Note on Security
--------------------------

* A **firewall** blocks unwanted traffic.
* Use `ufw` in Ubuntu to control what ports and connections are allowed.

* * *

🧪 Quick Questions for You
--------------------------

1.  What is an **IP address** in simple terms?
2.  What does **DNS** do?
3.  How do you check your IP on Ubuntu?
4.  What command is used to check if a website is reachable?
5.  What's the difference between **public** and **private** IP?

Now can you list out what are the topics that I need to cover for complete linux administrator/cloud administrator role. Leave the cloud platform exclusive fucntions or topics. First I want to cover all the things before that. Becasuse cloud is basically linux only right ?

You're absolutely right — **Linux is the foundation of the cloud**. Before diving into any cloud platform (like AWS, Azure, GCP), you must **master Linux system administration**.

Here’s a **complete and practical roadmap** for becoming a **Linux Administrator or Cloud Admin** (excluding cloud-platform-specific tools). This is **platform-agnostic**, meaning it applies whether you're working on servers, virtual machines, or in the cloud.

* * *

✅ **Essential Topics for Linux/Cloud Administrator (Before Cloud Platforms)**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧰 1\. **Linux Basics**

* What is Linux? Different distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, etc.)
* Linux folder structure (`/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/usr`, etc.)
* Shell vs terminal vs console
* TTYs and virtual consoles
* Using basic commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `clear`, `man`, `history`

* * *

* * *

Would you like a printable checklist or want to go through these topics **step-by-step**, like a course?

Let’s start building you into a confident Linux administrator! 🐧💪

What is Linux? Different distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, etc.)

Great! Let's start from the very **beginning** — this is a **very important** topic to understand for becoming a Linux or Cloud Admin.

* * *

🐧 **What is Linux?** (Simple English)
--------------------------------------

**Linux** is an **Operating System (OS)** — just like **Windows** or **macOS**.

But Linux is:

* **Free** and **Open Source** (anyone can use, modify, share)
* Mostly used in **servers**, **data centers**, **cloud**, and **supercomputers**
* Also used in **Android phones**, **routers**, **smart TVs**, and **IoT devices**

It controls your **hardware**, and provides a **platform to run apps**.

* * *

💡 Linux = Kernel + Tools
-------------------------

* The **Linux Kernel** is the **heart** of the OS — it talks to hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk).
* Other programs (like file managers, terminal, etc.) sit on top of it.

* * *

🧱 Why is Linux important?
--------------------------

* Almost **all servers in the world** run on Linux
* **Cloud computing (AWS, GCP, Azure)** is based on Linux
* It is **more secure**, **faster**, and **more stable** than Windows for backend work

* * *

📦 Different Distributions (Distros) of Linux
---------------------------------------------

A **Linux distribution** is like a **flavor or version** of Linux.
They all use the **Linux kernel**, but have different tools, software, and look.

Here are the main ones:

| Distribution | Description | Where it's used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ubuntu** | Most beginner-friendly. Used in desktops, servers, cloud. | Home, Cloud, Servers |
| **Debian** | Very stable. Ubuntu is based on this. | Servers |
| **CentOS** | (Now replaced by Rocky/AlmaLinux) – Community version of RHEL | Enterprise Servers |
| **RHEL** | Red Hat Enterprise Linux – Paid support, used by big companies | Enterprise |
| **Rocky Linux** | Free alternative to RHEL, very popular now | Data centers |
| **AlmaLinux** | Another RHEL-compatible alternative | Data centers |
| **Arch Linux** | Lightweight, highly customizable | Advanced users |
| **Kali Linux** | Used by hackers and penetration testers | Security testing |

✅ All distros have:

* Terminal
* Package manager
* Shell (bash, zsh)
* File system
* Kernel

* * *

🧪 Summary in One Line:
-----------------------

> **Linux** is a free operating system used in most servers and cloud computers, and it comes in many versions (called distros) like **Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL**, etc.

* * *

📝 Example Real-World Use:
--------------------------

* Ubuntu used in **AWS EC2** or local development
* RHEL used in **banks**, **enterprises**, and **data centers**
* Kali Linux used by **ethical hackers**

* * *

Sticky bit OSI model Linux file permssion Private IP address range types DNS SSH

Excellent topics! Let’s go one-by-one, in the **exact format** you asked:

* * *

🔐 1\. Sticky Bit
-----------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

A sticky bit is a special permission on a directory that allows **only the file owner or root** to delete or rename files inside it.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. Where is sticky bit used?**
Used in shared directories like `/tmp`.

**Q2. How to identify a sticky bit?**
With `ls -ld`, look for `t` in the permission, e.g. `drwxrwxrwt`.

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    chmod +t /shared-folder     # Add sticky bit
    chmod -t /shared-folder     # Remove sticky bit
    ls -ld /shared-folder       # View permissions


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

If many users can write in a folder (like `/tmp`), sticky bit makes sure they **can’t delete each other’s files**. Only the **file creator** can delete their file.

* * *

🌐 2\. OSI Model
----------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

The OSI model is a **7-layer framework** that describes how data travels over a network, from **application to hardware**.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. Name the 7 layers of OSI.**
App, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical

**Q2. Which layer does IP belong to?**
Network Layer

**Q3. Which layer does TCP/UDP belong to?**
Transport Layer

* * *

### 💻 **Commands (To see layer 3 & 4 info)**

    ip a             # Shows IP info (Layer 3)
    netstat -tunlp   # Shows TCP/UDP ports (Layer 4)


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

Think of OSI like **postal system**:
App writes letter → puts in envelope (Transport) → gets address (Network) → goes to delivery (Physical).
Each layer handles part of the journey.

* * *

🔒 3\. Linux File Permissions
-----------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

Linux uses **read, write, and execute** permissions for **owner, group, and others** to control access to files and folders.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What does 755 mean?**
Owner: all permissions; Group & Others: read and execute

**Q2. How do you change permissions?**
With `chmod`, e.g. `chmod 644 file`

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    ls -l filename           # View permissions
    chmod 755 file           # Set permission
    chown user:group file    # Change owner


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

Every file has **3 permission sets**: one for **owner**, one for **group**, and one for **others**.
Each can have **r (4), w (2), x (1)** — total is like math: `rwx = 7`.

* * *

🏠 4\. Private IP Address Range Types
-------------------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

Private IPs are reserved IP ranges used **within internal networks**, not routable over the internet.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. Name the private IP ranges.**

* Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
* Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
* Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

**Q2. Why use private IPs?**
To save public IPs and increase security.

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    ip a                  # Shows current IP
    ip route              # Shows routing table


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

Private IPs are like **house numbers in a colony** — they work inside but can’t be accessed from the outside internet without NAT (like a guard who maps your house to public).

* * *

🌍 5\. DNS (Domain Name System)
-------------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

DNS translates **domain names** like `google.com` into **IP addresses**, enabling access to websites using human-readable names.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What is `/etc/resolv.conf`?**
File that stores DNS server IPs used by the system.

**Q2. What is a DNS record?**
DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) map domains to IPs, services, or other domains.

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    dig google.com           # DNS query
    nslookup google.com      # DNS lookup
    cat /etc/resolv.conf     # View DNS servers


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

DNS is like **a phonebook** — you don’t need to remember IPs, just names. It finds the number (IP) behind a name (domain).

* * *

🔐 6\. SSH (Secure Shell)
-------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

SSH is a secure protocol used to **remotely access and manage** Linux systems over an encrypted connection.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What port does SSH use?**
Port 22 by default

**Q2. How do you generate SSH keys?**
Using `ssh-keygen`

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    ssh user@hostname          # Connect via SSH
    ssh-keygen                 # Create SSH key
    systemctl status ssh       # Check SSH service


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

SSH is like **remote control for Linux** — you can sit anywhere and work on your server securely. You log in with **password** or **key pair**.

* * *

Would you like me to continue with more topics in the same style?
You can send your next batch (5–10 topics), and I’ll keep this going.

Port numbers(FTP, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, TELNET) top df -TH free -h du -sh

* Telnet: 23

**Q2. Can you change default ports?**
Yes, but it’s done in the service’s config file.

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    ss -tuln                # Show listening ports
    netstat -tuln           # (older) Show ports
    ufw allow 22/tcp        # Allow SSH in firewall


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

Imagine ports like **TV channels** — each service listens on a certain “channel.” If you send data to port 22, you’re talking to SSH.

* * *

📊 2\. **`top` Command**
------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

`top` is a **real-time command-line tool** to monitor system processes, CPU usage, memory, and load average.

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

`top` is like **Task Manager** in Windows. It shows which programs are running and using your system’s CPU or RAM in real time.

* * *

💾 3\. **`df -TH` Command**
---------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

`df -TH` shows **disk space usage** for all mounted file systems, using **human-readable** and **terabyte/gigabyte units**.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What does `-T` do in `df -TH`?**
Shows the file system type (ext4, xfs, etc.)

**Q2. What is `/dev/sda1` in `df` output?**
It’s a partition on a storage disk.

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    df -TH                 # Show total disk usage
    df -h                  # Without filesystem type


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

`df` shows **how much disk is used** and free. `-T` shows type of filesystem. `-H` makes sizes easier to read (like GB or MB instead of blocks).

* * *

🧠 4\. **`free -h` Command**
----------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

`free -h` shows **available and used RAM** and **swap memory** in a human-readable format.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What is swap memory?**
A reserved space on disk used when RAM is full.

**Q2. What does `-h` do in `free -h`?**
Shows sizes in human-readable format like MB/GB.

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    free -h               # Shows RAM + Swap usage


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

Think of `free` like a **memory meter**. It tells you how much RAM you are using, how much is free, and how much "virtual RAM" (swap) is being used.

* * *

📦 5\. **`du -sh` Command**
---------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

`du -sh` shows the **disk usage** of a directory or file in **summary form and human-readable format**.

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What does `-s` and `-h` mean?**
`-s`: summary, `-h`: human-readable sizes.

**Q2. How to see size of all folders in a directory?**
Use `du -sh *`

* * *

### 💻 **Commands**

    du -sh /folder         # Size of folder
    du -sh *               # Size of everything in current dir


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for You:**

`du` checks how much space a folder is using. `-s` keeps it short. `-h` means sizes like 1G or 200M instead of raw bytes.

* * *

Package manager (ubuntu Linux - apt and RHEL - yum)

Great! Let's break down **Package Managers** in a clean, interview-friendly way with short definitions, questions, commands, and simple explanation for learning.

* * *

📦 **Package Manager (Ubuntu – `apt`, RHEL/CentOS – `yum` or `dnf`)**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

A **package manager** is a tool that installs, updates, removes, and manages software packages in Linux.

* Ubuntu/Debian uses: `apt`
* RHEL/CentOS uses: `yum` (or `dnf` in newer versions)

* * *

### ❓ **Sub-questions & Answers**

**Q1. What is a package?**
A compressed file containing software and its dependencies.

**Q2. Difference between `apt` and `yum`?**
They work similarly but are used on different Linux distributions (`apt` for Debian-based, `yum/dnf` for RHEL-based).

**Q3. What is the difference between `yum` and `dnf`?**
`dnf` is the modern replacement for `yum` with better performance and dependency handling.

* * *

### 💻 **Common `apt` Commands (Ubuntu)**

    sudo apt update            # Refresh package list from internet
    sudo apt upgrade           # Upgrade installed packages
    sudo apt install nginx     # Install a package (e.g., nginx)
    sudo apt remove nginx      # Remove a package
    sudo apt search nginx      # Search for a package
    sudo apt list --installed  # List installed packages


* * *

    sudo yum remove nginx        # Remove a package
    sudo yum search nginx        # Search for a package
    sudo yum list installed      # List installed packages


> ✅ In **newer RHEL versions**, use `dnf` instead of `yum`.
> Example: `sudo dnf install nginx`

* * *

### 🧠 **Explanation for You (Simple)**

A **package manager is like a Play Store for Linux**.
When you want to install or update software, instead of downloading from a website, you use `apt` or `yum` to do it for you.

* `apt` works on Ubuntu (like `.deb` files)
* `yum` or `dnf` works on Red Hat systems (like `.rpm` files)

* * *

Let me know if you want a mini quiz, or shall we go to the next topic like **Systemd**, **crontab**, **firewall**, etc.?

Then basic linux command Like creating file and folder Viewing file and editing file Removing file touch, mkdir, cat, vim or nano

Perfect! Let’s now cover **basic Linux commands** — the ones every beginner **must know** for daily use. These are often asked in interviews and **used all the time** in real work.

* * *

📝 **File & Directory Commands**
--------------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

Linux provides basic commands to **create**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** files and folders using the terminal.

* * *

### 🔧 **1\. `touch` – Create a file**

* Listing files (`ls`)
* File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
* Searching files (`find`, `grep`)
    Let me know!

lvm

Great! Let's now explore **LVM** — a core Linux concept often used in enterprise environments and asked in interviews.

* * *

🧱 **LVM – Logical Volume Manager**
-----------------------------------

### ✅ **Definition (Interview):**

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible management of disk space by creating logical volumes on top of physical storage.

It lets you **resize**, **create**, and **combine** partitions without restarting the system.

* * *

### 🔍 **Sub-questions and Answers (under 2 lines each)**

**Q: What is the use of LVM?**
To manage storage flexibly — you can resize, extend, shrink, and combine disks without unmounting.

**Q: What is a Physical Volume (PV)?**
A physical disk or partition prepared for LVM using `pvcreate`.

**Q: What is a Volume Group (VG)?**
A group of one or more physical volumes that act as a storage pool.

**Q: What is a Logical Volume (LV)?**
The usable space (like a partition) created from the volume group.

* * *

### 🧱 **LVM Structure**

    Hard Disk → PV → VG → LV → Mount → Use


Like:

    [ /dev/sdb ] → [ PV ] → [ VG_data ] → [ LV_docs ] → [ /mnt/docs ]


* * *

### 💻 **LVM Commands (with explanation)**

    # Step 1: Create a Physical Volume
    sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb

    # Step 2: Create a Volume Group
    sudo vgcreate vgdata /dev/sdb

    # Step 3: Create a Logical Volume (5GB)
    sudo lvcreate -L 5G -n lvdata vgdata

    # Step 4: Format the LV with ext4 filesystem
    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vgdata/lvdata

    # Step 5: Mount the volume
    sudo mkdir /mnt/lvdata
    sudo mount /dev/vgdata/lvdata /mnt/lvdata

    # (Optional) Resize Logical Volume
    sudo lvextend -L +2G /dev/vgdata/lvdata
    sudo resize2fs /dev/vgdata/lvdata


* * *

### 📘 **Explanation for Beginners**

* **LVM is like combining multiple drives into one big flexible drawer.**
* You don’t need to worry about fixed partition sizes.
* You can add new drives later and just expand the space — no need to move files or reformat.

* * *

Would you like a **diagram or mini quiz** on LVM, or should we continue to **next topic** like `df`, `mount`, or disk partitioning with `fdisk`/`lsblk`?

next topic like df, mount, or disk partitioning with fdisk/lsblk

Awesome! Let's now dive into **Disk Management Tools** in Linux – very important for **system administration**, **troubleshooting**, and **interviews**.

* * *

🔧 Disk Partitioning and Monitoring in Linux
--------------------------------------------

We'll cover these essential commands:

1.  **`df`** – Check disk usage
2.  **`mount` / `umount`** – Mount and unmount disks
3.  **`fdisk`** – Create or delete disk partitions
4.  **`lsblk`** – View block devices (disks)
5.  **`blkid`** – Show UUIDs and filesystem types
6.  **`mount -a`**, `/etc/fstab` – Auto-mount at boot

* * *

### ✅ 1\. `df` – Disk Free

> Shows **disk usage** of all mounted filesystems.

    df -h


📘 `-h` = human readable (shows GB, MB)

✅ **Example Output**:

    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1        50G   20G   27G  43% /


* * *

### ✅ 2\. `mount` / `umount` – Attach/detach storage

#### 🟢 Mount:

    sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data


✅ Mounts a partition (like USB or extra drive) to a folder.

#### 🔴 Unmount:

    sudo umount /mnt/data


⚠️ Must unmount before formatting or removing the drive safely.

* * *

### ✅ 3\. `fdisk` – Partitioning Tool (for MBR disks)

    sudo fdisk /dev/sdb


➡️ Interactive menu:

* `n` – new partition
* `d` – delete
* `w` – write changes
* `p` – print partition table

📘 After creating a new partition, format it using:

    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1


* * *

### ✅ 4\. `lsblk` – List block devices

    lsblk


✅ Shows all disks and their partitions in tree view.

Example:

    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0   50G  0 disk
    ├─sda1   8:1    0   50G  0 part /
    sdb      8:16   0  100G  0 disk


* * *

### ✅ 5\. `blkid` – Show block device UUIDs

    sudo blkid


✅ Helps when configuring permanent mounts in `/etc/fstab`.

* * *

### ✅ 6\. Auto Mounting at Boot – `/etc/fstab`

To mount a drive permanently at boot:

    sudo nano /etc/fstab


Add line like:

    UUID=xxxx-xxxx   /mnt/data  ext4  defaults  0  2


Use `blkid` to get UUID.

Then test with:

    sudo mount -a


* * *

### 📘 Simple Analogy:

* `df` – Like checking how full your cupboard is
* `mount` – Like plugging in a USB drive
* `fdisk` – Like dividing your hard disk into rooms
* `lsblk` – Like looking at a map of all rooms in your house
* `fstab` – Like setting up auto-plugins on startup

* * *

### 🔎 Mini Interview Q&A

**Q: How to check disk usage?**
Use `df -h`

**Q: How to mount a USB drive?**
Use `mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb`

**Q: How to see partitions and structure?**

* * *

### ✅ Commands Recap

    df -h                  # Check disk space
    mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt   # Mount a drive
    umount /mnt            # Unmount it
    fdisk /dev/sdb         # Partition a disk
    lsblk                  # Show disk structure
    blkid                  # Show UUIDs of drives
    mount -a               # Test fstab file

Explain the OSI layer and its items

* * *

🌐 What is the OSI Model?
-------------------------

> **Definition (Interview Answer):**
> The **OSI model** (Open Systems Interconnection model) is a 7-layer framework that describes how data moves from one device to another over a network.

It helps standardize how different devices and software communicate.

* * *

🧱 7 Layers of the OSI Model (from top to bottom)
-------------------------------------------------

| Layer | Name | Function (Simple English) | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | **Application** | Where users interact with software | Browser, Email app |
| 6   | **Presentation** | Translates and formats data | Encryption, JPEG |
| 5   | **Session** | Starts and ends communication between devices | Login sessions |
| 4   | **Transport** | Ensures reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP) | TCP, UDP |
| 3   | **Network** | Chooses the best path for data (routing) | IP address, Router |
| 2   | **Data Link** | Transfers data between connected devices | MAC address |
| 1   | **Physical** | Sends raw bits through cables or Wi-Fi | Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi signal |

* * *

### 🔍 Simple Analogy – **Sending a Letter**

* Layer 7 – You write the message (application)
* Layer 6 – Translate it if needed (presentation)
* Layer 5 – Start/End conversation (session)
* Layer 4 – Ensure it’s delivered correctly (transport)
* Layer 3 – Choose route to send (network)
* Layer 2 – Address it to the right person (data link)
* Layer 1 – Physically send it via post (physical)

Explain TCP and UDP

Sure! Let’s understand **TCP and UDP** – they are very important networking concepts, especially for Linux or Cloud administrators. These are part of the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** in the OSI Model.

* * *

📌 What is TCP and UDP?
-----------------------

> **Definition (Interview Style):**
> **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** are two transport layer protocols used to send data over a network.
> TCP is **reliable and connection-oriented**, while UDP is **faster and connectionless**.

* * *

🔄 Comparison: TCP vs UDP (Simple Table)
----------------------------------------

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection Type | Connection-oriented (handshake) | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Reliable (guarantees delivery) | Not reliable (no guarantee) |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Error Checking | Yes (retransmits lost data) | Minimal |
| Order of Data | Maintains order | Order not guaranteed |
| Use Cases | Web (HTTP), Email, FTP | Streaming, DNS, VoIP |
| Overhead | More | Less |

* * *

### 🎯 Simple Analogy:

* **TCP is like a phone call** ☎️

    * You say hello (handshake), talk, confirm messages, then hang up.
* **UDP is like a postcard** 📨

    * You just send it. If it gets lost, no one knows.

* * *

🔧 Commands to Test TCP and UDP
-------------------------------

### 🔹 TCP Example:

    telnet google.com 80      # Tests TCP port 80 (HTTP)


### 🔹 UDP Example:

    nc -u 8.8.8.8 53           # Tests UDP to DNS server on port 53


* * *

✅ Interview Questions & Answers
-------------------------------

**Q: What is TCP?**
A: TCP is a connection-based protocol that ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data.

**Q: What is UDP?**
A: UDP is a connectionless protocol that sends data faster but without guarantee of delivery.

**Q: Where is TCP used?**
A: Used in web (HTTP/HTTPS), FTP, emails – where data reliability matters.

**Q: Where is UDP used?**
A: Used in live streaming, DNS, VoIP – where speed is more important than accuracy.

**Q: Can you name a port that uses TCP and another that uses UDP?**
A: Port 80 uses TCP (HTTP), Port 53 uses UDP (DNS).
